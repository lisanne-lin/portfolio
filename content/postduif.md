<h2> The project </h2>

During the pandemic, shops had to close and orders could only be delivered or picked up. However, even when the restrictions were less strict and shops were reopening, customers still wanted to order online and have items delivered. Entrepreneurs prefer to maintain control over the service they provide to their customers, so there is a need for a solution to deliver these orders.

The task was to develop a web application that allows entrepreneurs their packages for delivery and can share the same delivery service. When registering a package, various options can be specified, like express delivery, eco-friendly delivery, and delivery during a specific time slot, package sizes, weight etc.

<h3>Our idea</h3>
The idea was to focus on being an eco-friendly delivery services for small businesses and supporting local communities by distributing a share of the money from customers who use the delivery service to various charitable causes, such as neighborhood initiatives, community centers, garden constructions, and other charities located within Amsterdam.

<h3>App features</h3>

<h4>Business owners</h4>

When they have their own account, they can register packages/orders that are prepared for delivery and include information such as package weight, address, price and delivery fee.

<h4>Delivery person</h4>

After packages/orders are registered, they will be added to a list for the delivery person to view. From there, the delivery person can select an order they want to deliver and the status will change in the overview. Once the order is delivered, the delivery person must confirm this, and then the order will be removed from the overview

<h4>Customers</h4>

Customers can use the app to track their packages.

<h3> My contribution </h3>
I have done the most of the design of the web-app. To push myself out of the comfort zone, I decided to incorporate yellow, which is a color I typically don't like and is not a easy color to work with in the design. I paired it with green to create a more eco-friendly vibe, which turned out to be a good fit for the delivery service. Yellow symbolizes the speed, and green represents eco-friendliness.

Other than that I have made the delivery person panel. By using Leaflet.js I included a map with address of the destination. The panel displays the delivery status of every order, along with other informations such as address, customer name order number and date.

<h3>What I have learned</h3>

-   Although I'm not typically the type of person that takes charge in a team, I stepped up when our group faced challenges, such as losing two members and being left with only three of us. I saw that we needed organization and structure within the team, and took on the role of a leader. In doing so, I learned to effectively communicate with my team and involve them in decision-making processes to make sure that everyone was on board and comfortable with the direction we were taking.

-   We had a combination of Dutch and English in our code, so we had to choose a language for conistiency and readabilty. We opted for English since we had already written a large part of the code in that language, except for the queries and the database. The conversion process took us a lot of time and resulted in the website being full of bugs and errors. In the future, I will write my code in English unless another language is specified.
